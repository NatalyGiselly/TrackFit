---

Perform accessibility audit and fixes following WCAG 2.0 AA guidelines:

1. Check all interactive elements for:
   - accessibilityLabel
   - accessibilityHint
   - accessibilityRole
   - Minimum touch target (44x44pt)

2. Validate color contrast:
   - Text: 4.5:1 ratio
   - UI components: 3:1 ratio
   - Check both light and dark themes

3. Screen reader testing:
   - Logical reading order
   - Meaningful labels
   - State announcements

4. Keyboard navigation (if applicable)

5. Focus management

Ask me for:
1. Component/screen to audit
2. Or run full app audit

Then:
1. List all accessibility issues found
2. Categorize by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
3. Provide fixes for each issue
4. Suggest testing approach
